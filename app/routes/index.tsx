        <p>
          I live in sleepy south Alabama with my beautiful wife{' '}
          <a href="https://tararickaby.com/">Tara</a> and our three children. In
          my spare time, I enjoy taking photos, cheering for the Green Bay
          Packers, and playing bass guitar. Way back in 1997, I built my first
          web site on Geocities and have been passionate about the web since!

        <Title order={3}>Contributions</Title>
        <p>
          I've been part of the WordPress community since 2006. I've made
          contributions to core, documentation, plugins, and themes. I've also
          spoken at WordCamps and meet-ups. I'm also a contributor to other
          open-source projects like Next.js, Storybook, and Gatsby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I volunteer my time and efforts at local community
          organizations. The Boy Scouts, Wiregrass Church, and the Enterprise
          High School Band Boosters to name a few.
